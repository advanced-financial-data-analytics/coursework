## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic characteristics of financial time series data (like trends, patterns, and how much it fluctuates)
- Explore and visualize data using charts and graphs
- Build statistical models to forecast future values
- Explain what the analysis tells us about the data and what it means in practice
- Communicate your research findings in a written report
- Effectively present complex analytical findings through concise verbal and visual communication
- Develop communication skills that differentiate human expertise from AI-generated content
- Practice professional presentation methods essential for careers in financial analytics

## Communication Skills in the Age of AI

In today's professional environment, the ability to effectively communicate complex financial findings is as valuable as the technical analysis itself. With AI increasingly able to generate basic reports and analyses, human professionals must demonstrate skills that go beyond what artificial intelligence can produce:

1. **Contextualized interpretation**: While AI can generate analyses, human experts provide critical context, insight, and judgment that connects findings to real-world implications.

2. **Compelling storytelling**: The 5-minute presentation component challenges you to distill complex information into a compelling narrativeâ€”a distinctly human skill that AI struggles to replicate authentically.

3. **Balanced judgment**: AI can present data but lacks the nuanced judgment to determine which findings merit emphasis for specific audiences or business decisions.

4. **Trust and credibility**: Financial stakeholders need to trust both the analysis and the analyst. Your presentation skills build the foundation for establishing professional credibility in ways AI cannot.

The 20% allocation to the video presentation reflects the growing importance of these communication abilities in financial analytics careers. As AI tools become more prevalent for generating basic analyses, employers increasingly value professionals who can effectively interpret, contextualize, and communicate findings in accessible ways.

# Project Requirements

## About Quarto Documents

This assessment requires you to submit your work as a Quarto document (`.qmd` file). Quarto is a modern publishing system that allows you to:

- Write text and code in the same document
- Generate high-quality PDF and HTML outputs
- Include interactive visualizations and tables
- Show or hide code as needed

Your Quarto document should include:

- All your analysis code in clearly labeled code chunks
- Your written report with integrated figures and tables
- References and citations

**You do not need to submit separate R scripts if all your code is included in the Quarto document.** The code chunks in your document should be well-organized and commented.

## Posit Cloud Requirement

This project must be completed on Posit Cloud (formerly RStudio Cloud), similar to all the tutorials and workshops in this course. You will have access to:

- A Quarto template for the project
- A pre-configured environment with all the relevant packages already installed
- The datasets from the `tsfe` package

Using Posit Cloud ensures consistency in your computing environment and makes it easier for you to focus on the analysis rather than setting up the technical infrastructure. It also ensures that your project will be reproducible when evaluated.

Instructions for accessing the project template and environment will be provided separately.

## Glossary of Key Terms

To help you understand the technical language, here's a glossary of key terms:

- **Time Series:** A sequence of data points collected over time (e.g., daily stock prices, monthly inflation rates).
- **Stationarity:** Imagine a river flowing steadily. A stationary time series is like that - its statistical properties (like average and variability) don't change over time.
- **Autocorrelation:** Think of it like ripples on water. Autocorrelation measures how much a data point is related to previous data points in the same time series.
- **Volatility:**  This is how much the data jumps around.  High volatility means big price swings!
- **ARIMA Model:** A common model used to forecast future values in time series data. It's like using a special recipe that considers past values and errors to predict what might happen next.
- **GARCH Model:**  A model that helps us understand and predict how volatility changes over time. Think of it like a weather forecast for how "stormy" the market might get.
- **Cointegration:**  This means that two time series have a long-term relationship, even if they move apart in the short term. Imagine two friends who always end up at the same place, even if they take different routes.
- **Machine Learning:**  A way to get computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It's like teaching a dog a trick with treats - the computer learns by finding patterns in the data.


## Data Sources

The `tsfe` R package provides several financial datasets that you can choose from:

1.  **Market Indices:**
    -   Russell 2000 Price Index: Measures the performance of small-cap US companies.
    -   FTSE 100 Index: Measures the performance of the 100 largest companies on the London Stock Exchange.
    -   China A-Market Index: Measures the performance of stocks traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges in China.

2.  **Exchange Rates:**
    -   USD/GBP exchange rates: The value of the US dollar relative to the British pound.

3.  **Company Data:**
    -   Carnival Plc earnings per share: A measure of the company's profitability.
    -   Historical stock prices: The price of a company's stock over time.

## Research Questions and Report Structure

Your report should investigate three related research questions (one from each section below) that form a coherent analysis. For example, you might examine market volatility through increasingly sophisticated lenses: first exploring its basic properties, then modeling it, and finally conducting advanced analysis.

### Example of Connected Research Questions:
- **Section 1:** "How has the volatility of the USD/GBP exchange rate changed over time?" (Exploratory Analysis)
- **Section 2:** "What's the best GARCH model for figuring out how volatile the market is?" (Time Series Modeling applied to the same exchange rate)
- **Section 3:** "Can machine learning predict financial markets better than traditional methods?" (Comparing ML predictions of exchange rate volatility against your GARCH model)

This progression builds a comprehensive analysis: first understanding what volatility looks like, then modeling it with traditional methods, and finally assessing if advanced techniques offer improvements.

### Section 1: Exploratory Analysis (24 marks - approximately 750 words)

1.  **"Do stock prices for smaller US companies (Russell 2000) behave in the way theory suggests?"**
    -   Look at how the returns are spread out.
    -   Check if the returns follow a typical bell-shaped curve.
    -   See if periods of high volatility tend to happen together.
    -   Compare what you see in the data to what economic theory predicts.

2.  **"What patterns can we find in Carnival Plc's quarterly earnings?"**
    -   Identify any long-term trends or repeating seasonal patterns.

# Academic Integrity

## Plagiarism Policy

All work must be your own. Make sure to reference all your sources properly using the APA 7th edition format. The university's academic integrity policy applies to everything you submit.

## Code Attribution

If you adapt any code from external sources (like websites or textbooks), clearly comment on it in your code and provide the appropriate citations.

## AI Policy

I expect you to use generative AI in this class. Some assignments will require it. Learning to use AI is an emerging skill, and I provide some tutorials in Canvas about how to use it. I am happy to meet and help with these tools during my coding clinics or after class.

**Responsible AI Use:**

* **Effort Matters:**  The quality of your AI-generated output depends on the effort you put into crafting your prompts. Generic or low-effort prompts will likely result in low-quality outputs. Take the time to refine your prompts to achieve meaningful results.

* **Verification is Essential:**  Don't blindly trust the information provided by AI tools. Always double-check facts and figures, especially those you are unfamiliar with. You are responsible for any errors or omissions in the AI-generated content you use.

* **Acknowledge AI Assistance:**  Transparency is key. When you use AI tools in your work, include a paragraph at the end of your assignment explaining:
    * Which AI tools you used (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard).
    * How you used them (e.g., generating code, summarizing research, brainstorming ideas).
    * The prompts you used to obtain the results.

    Failure to acknowledge AI assistance is considered a violation of academic integrity policies.

* **Use AI Judiciously:**  AI is a powerful tool, but it's not always the right tool for every task.  Think critically about when AI is appropriate and helpful for your analysis. Avoid over-reliance on AI, and ensure that your own understanding and insights are central to your work.  See this [article](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/new-cnils-guidelines-on-ai-models-a-practical-approach-amidst-eus-regulatory-tangles) for how to be judicious.

**Module Coordinator's Expertise:**

Please be aware that the module coordinator has extensive research expertise in the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI. This means they are well-equipped to identify instances of inappropriate or unacknowledged AI use in student work.

**Consequences of Academic Misconduct:**

Any violation of the university's academic integrity policies, including plagiarism, improper code attribution, or failure to acknowledge AI assistance, will be subject to investigation and may result in serious penalties.
